This is a list of bugs and missing functionality that needs to be fixed in
the near term.

Front-end
=========

(p1) Fix parsing of floats, strings, and integer literals of different widths.
(p1) Report position of syntax errors.

(p2) Better recovery after parse errors.


Middle-end
==========

(p1) Finish missing cases in rewriting pass:
     + CFG -> CFG rewriting
     + rewriting in non-CFG contexts (type expressions) and nested CFGs.
(p1) Add variables and conversion to SSA.
(p1) Add loops.
(p1) Add CFG simplification & cleanup pass (unused phi, dup vars, empty BBs)
(p1) Add records, slots, and inheritance.
(p1) Add arithmetic up-conversions and type-checking.
(p1) Calculate numUses and distance metric for variables.

(p2) Add initial type-checking pass.
(p2) Implement lazy rewriting.
(p2) Implement partial evaluator.


Back-end
=========

(p1) Find and solve constraints.
(p1) Register allocation.
(p1) Emit x86 instructions for CFG.
(p1) JIT-compiler. (Create code page, emit instructions to code page, and run.)


Misc
====

(p1) Make test infrastructure to automatically run tests.
